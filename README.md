## WordPress LSCS REST shortcode plugin

This is a simple prototype plugin for WordPress which goes out to a LiveSite Content Server (LSCS) and fetches data for display on a page or post within WP.

The plugin is hard-coded to a specific server instance and to specific XML files, but it does show the basic method with which a WordPress plugin could fetch and display this data from the LSCS box in real-time for purposes of creating a dynamic page within WP.

## Installation
####1. Create a directory in your WP instance as follows:

```sh
your-path/wp-content/plugins/lscs-rest
```

####2. Copy the files to the new directory
 
####3. Open the WP Admin panel, go to plugins, and enable the plugin  

####4. Place plugins as desired into your WP pages or posts using either [LSCS-Banner] or [LSCS-Promo]
